# DSS-for-Machine-Scheduling
Developed a Streamlit based scheduling decision support system that lets users specify classic scheduling problems using 3 field notation and constraints, select objectives such as makespan, total completion time, weighted completion time, maximum lateness, and total tardiness, and solve them using dispatching rules or metaheuristics.
